# Weather App

This is a mobile app that provides weather information.

# Architecture Differences

Android applications are distributed in several architecture variants depending on the type of processor used by the Android device. Here are some commonly used architectures:

- armeabi: Architecture for devices with ARM processors version 5 or newer. Used on older Android devices with limited support.

- arm64: Architecture for devices with 64-bit ARM processors. Used on newer Android devices and provides better performance and support for the latest features.

- x86: Architecture for devices with Intel or AMD x86 processors. Used on Android emulators or devices with x86 architecture such as some Android tablets or laptops.

It is important to consider the architecture used when developing your application and ensure that your app is distributed with support for various architectures. This allows the app to run smoothly on different Android devices.
